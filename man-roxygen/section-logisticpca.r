#' @section {Logistic SVD-based models}:
#' 

#' Landgraf and Lee (2020) provide dimension reduction tools for binary data in
#' their package **logisticPCA**. The signature functions
#' [logisticPCA::logisticPCA()], [logisticPCA::logisticSVD()], and
#' [logisticPCA::convexLogisticPCA()] have `*_ord()` wrappers that add row and
#' column names from the input matrix to the output matrices.
