#' @section {Penalized matrix decomposition}:
#' 

#' Witten, Tibshirani, and Hastie (2009) provide a theoretical basis and
#' computational algorithm for penalized matrix decomposition that specializes
#' to sparse PCA and to sparse CCA. Their R package **PMA** implements these
#' specializations as well as one to sparse multiple CCA.
